DOOM-Inspired FPS Game

A classic DOOM-style first-person shooter built as a learning project to understand the core mechanics behind old-school FPS games.
This project focuses on game logic, raycasting, movement, shooting, and enemy interaction rather than graphics-heavy engines.

🎮 About the Game

This is a retro-inspired FPS game influenced by the original DOOM (1993).
The goal of this project was to learn how first-person shooters work internally, including rendering walls using raycasting, handling player input, and managing enemies.

⚠️ This is a non-commercial, educational project.
